Filtering will be done though blocking information requests from explicit domain names, or website addresses.

<div class="tip">
  <h5>No Filter is Perfect</h5>
  <p>Despite the great job that OpenDNS does keeping its list of explicit sites up to date, it can't cover all the internet and the new sites popping up daily. Fortunately, OpenDNS still does a very good job.</p>
  <p>But to really keep explicit content out of your home, make sure to move your computer and other electronic devices into a well trafficked area of your house. When anyone can see what's on the screen, it keeps people from being tempted to visit anything inappropriate.</p>
