Filtering will be done though blocking information requests from explicit domain names, or website addresses.

<div class="tip">
  <h5>No Filter is Perfect</h5>
  <p>Despite the great job that OpenDNS does keeping its list of explicit sites up to date, no filter is perfect.</p>
  <p>To really keep explicit content out of your home, make sure to move your computer and other electronic devices into a well trafficked area of your home. When anyone can see what's on the screen, it helps everyone stay accountable for their internet usage.</p>

## Setting Up OpenDNS for Filtering
1. Sign up for the free [OpenDNS Home](http://www.opendns.com/home-solutions/parental-controls/) service.
1. Follow the instructions to add your home network.
1. Click on your newly created home network IP address and then click on `Web Content Filtering` if you aren't already there.
1. Choose the level of filtering you want or select `Custom` and select the categories you would like to filter out.
1. Download and install the OpenDNS updater for [Mac OS X](https://www.opendns.com/download/mac) or [Windows](https://www.opendns.com/download/windows) on a computer that remains on and in your home. The updater makes sure your network is using OpenDNS.

  <h5>OpenDNS Home versus OpenDNS Family Shield</h5>
  <p>You may have noticed OpenDNS provides a service called Family Shield. Family Shield is a pre-configured blocker of explicit content.</p>
  <p>While this is a good choice for many, OpenDNS Home provides the same protection but with more options, including the ability to blacklist or white list specific sites for greater control. It also provides logging tools for checking up on activity. As such, we advocate using Home.</p>
