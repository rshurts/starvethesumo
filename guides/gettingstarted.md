## Welcome

This site aims to provide a comprehensive approach to blocking explicit content from your home network and the devices attached to that network. Specific security practices are employed to prevent content filters from being bypassed and to create a more secure computing environment.

## Using the Guides

## Tips
Throughout the guides there are a number of tips. Some are security focued, others explain technical details, and some point out practices or tools that may be handy. It isn't necessary to perform any or all the actions listed in the tip (the sumo can be starved successfully without doing so), but doing so will take your setup to the next level.
