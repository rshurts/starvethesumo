## Welcome
This site aims to provide a comprehensive approach to blocking explicit content on your home network and the devices attached to that network. Specific security practices are employed to prevent content filters from being bypassed and to create a more secure computing environment.

## Using the Guides
The guides are presented in the order in which you should complete them. They follow a workflow of setting up your home network to block content, setting up your devices to use your network and prevent circumvention of the blocks, and finally using controls to monitor activity.

Each guide is a separate step in the entire process. Each guide can be completed individually, so you don't have to complete all the guides at once. However, it is recommended that you complete a guide before taking a break or moving on to the next one.

Because of the number of different devices out there, some guides my not be applicable to you. If you only use Windows computers, the Mac OS X guide won't be useful to you. Feel free to skip these guides and move on to the next one.

## Tips
Throughout the guides there are a number of tips in boxes. Tips help explain what is going on and give pointers on improving your setup. Tips are completely optional, so feel free to use them or ignore them at your own discretion.
